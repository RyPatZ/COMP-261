Minimum out of 30:
* [10] Finds articulation points in one connected component of the graph (the graph may be disconnected by itself).
* [5] Uses the correct graph structure, i.e. ignores one way. (Articulation points should use an undirected graph.)
* [5] Displays the selected nodes. (i.e. displays art pts)
* [5] Have a report with pseudocode of the algorithms.
* [5] Finds articulation points in all components of the (disconnected) graph.

Core out of 30 (up to 60):
* [10] Finds a minimum spanning tree in one connected component of the graph (the graph may be disconnected by itself).
* [5] Uses the correct graph structure, i.e. ignores one way and with edge weight.
* [5] Displays the found minimum spanning tree.
* [5] Have a report with pseudocode of the algorithms.
* [5] Finds minimum spanning trees for all components of the (disconnected) graph.

Completion out of 28 (up to 88):
* [10] Answer the question about articulation points.
* [10] Answer the question about minimum spanning tree.
* [8] Answer the first question about Fast Fourier Transform.

Challenge out of 17 (up to 100, with 5 spare marks):
* [5] Uses the iterative version of the articulation points algorithm.
* [5] Uses Kruskal's algorithm with the disjoint set data structure.
* [7] Answer the second question about Fast Fourier Transform.
